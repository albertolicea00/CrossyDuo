## NetworkManager (autoload "Net").
##
## Handles the three connection modes required by the spec:
##   LOCAL  - single device, no networking at all.
##   HOST   - this instance hosts an offline-LAN game (and also plays).
##   CLIENT - this instance joins a LAN host by local IP.
##
## "Local Server" mode is HOST with strict server-side validation enabled:
## the host then verifies every client request (cooldowns, lane validity)
## instead of trusting the remote peer.
